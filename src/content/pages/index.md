I have been working in the computer science field for since 2014. I started off as a help desk employee at my first job and worked my wway up as a front end developer for that same company. I ended up getting my bachelor's and started working on professionally as an engineer in 2017.

I am on Upwork as well! If you have a project that you wish for me to start working on through UpWork, [hire me](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~017cb997c760da76e7) there!
